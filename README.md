How to install 
==============

For some reasons I’ve chosen to partially track my LazyVim setup rather than maintaining a full repository of configuration files. To get started, you’ll first need to install LazyVim:

    rm -fr ~/.config/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/state/nvim ~/.cache/nvim
    git clone https://github.com/LazyVim/starter ~/.config/nvim

Then manually copy the contents of the `lua/plugins/`, `lua/configs/` and `init.lua` to your local configuration.
